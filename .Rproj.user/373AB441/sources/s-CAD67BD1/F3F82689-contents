# README

Repo for iecastro.github.io - a  site to post some analyses and visualizations. The site is set so that I can create R Markdown documents 
and then push to the site from RStudio.  Still working out some kinks though.

It took me two days of trial and error (and some head banging against the wall) to get the site up. I was able to accomplish this, in
no small part, by reading, cloning, copying, combining, ..etc, from the following repos:
