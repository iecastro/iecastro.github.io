I know some R, I know some stats, I know spatial data science (ugh, too much, huh?). I don't consider myself a scientist. Or a "data guy". Or maybe that's just the [imposter syndrome](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2017/12/10/feel-like-a-fraud-heres-how-to-overcome-imposter-syndrome/#6944d63e4d31). However, if I can "recognize" imposter sysndrome, then I'm probably not experiencing it - I'm just inadequate. Would you judge me by my GRE scores? I certainly know very litte. But, I did learn some cool stuff in school. From some of the smartest people I know. Is that the imposter syndrome again? Nah, I really am just inexperienced. But, what is experience? or success?

In all seriousness - success begins with training. I enjoy working with data, especially "real-world" data (although, I don't work with data for a living. Bummer). I don't have many answers. I have tons of questions. I'm interested in population health and spatial epidemiology. 

Here you'll find data stuff I've worked on, mostly in R, mostly Open, mostly just exploratory.
