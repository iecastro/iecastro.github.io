title: A descriptive look at Veteran unemployment

On any given year, is the President really the one to praise (or blame) for the country's economic situation? I don't ask this in a partisan way, I simply don't understand the intricacies of [economics](https://www.npr.org/tags/146988256/u-s-economy). How important are State-level economic policies? What about local goverments? When employment statistics are released, they tend to vary by industry, location, and population. Not all Americans experience the same economy. Ultimately, the economy is a complex system, and statistics come with a certain level of uncertainty and manipulation.


Lets look at this statistic:

That is great, no doubt --but, it doesn't tell us everything. If we look at the annual averages for 2017, we can see that unemployment among Veterans differs by State. Is the economic environment in Rhode Island that much different from vermont or Maine? Why?

## New York Data

Let's look at New York State. Open Data NY released numbers on the [*Employment Status of the Veteran Population*](https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Employment-Status-of-the-Veteran-Population-18-Yea/xnam-chv6). This is great because the BLS does not release these numbers by state. 

The NYS Department of Labor derived annual averages from [Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm) (CPS) sample records. CPS is a national, monthly, household survey, with about 2,300 households interviewed in NYS each month.

This post will describe and summarize these estimates

*Before proceeding, it's important to note these data are not official BLS estimates, and have limitations on how they were sampled and calculated.*

### Veteran unemployment 

In NYS, the unemployment rate among Post-9/11 Veterans has had a downward trend
over the years. However, with the exception of 2015 & 2017, unemployment in this population is higher than non-Veterans (and all Veterans).

*Unemployed* refers to people in the labor force who are not working but have been looking for work and are currently available to work. The labor force is comprised of all who are either employed or unemployed. The percentage of the labor force unemployed is the unemployment rate -- although, it is not really a [rate](http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/PH/BasicQuantitativeConcepts/BasicQuantitativeConcepts4.html), but, what do I know?

### Veteran participation rate

The labor force participation rate (again, not really a rate) of Post-9/11 Veterans hasn't dropped below 75% in almost a decade. You may have never heard of the participation rate (I hadn't until I started exploring this dataset), but, in 2016 the NYS labor force participation rate was [62.8%](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/economic/labor-force-trends-nys-2017.pdf) -- that is, one-third of the working age population (not in prison or active duty military) does not participate in the labor force.  The national participation rate is not any [higher](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000).
